#Selenium File Downloader Utility
#Overview
This Java utility facilitates the downloading of files from a given URL, a common requirement in web automation tasks. It's particularly useful when automating web interactions using Selenium WebDriver.

#Prerequisites
Before using this utility, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

**Java Development Kit (JDK):**
Install the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website.
**Selenium WebDriver:**
Include Selenium WebDriver dependencies in your Java project. You can use tools like Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
Example Maven dependency:
xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>3.141.59</version>
</dependency>
**WebDriver Executable:**
Download the WebDriver executable for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox). Ensure it is placed in your system PATH or specify its location in your code.
**IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**
Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for Java development.

#Requirements
Navigate to Web Content: The utility should be able to navigate to a specified web page using Selenium WebDriver.
Locate Download Link Element: It should locate and interact with the download link element on the webpage using Selenium WebDriver. Example:

WebElement pdfLink = driver.findElement(By.linkText("Download a Printable PDF of this Cheat Sheet"));
Download PDF File: After locating the download link, it should initiate the download and save the file to a specified destination on the local file system. Additionally, it should verify if the file has been successfully downloaded. Example:

downloadFile("https://example.com/sample.pdf", "downloaded_file.pdf");
File Verification: It should verify the existence of the downloaded file at the specified destination. If the file is present, it should indicate successful download; otherwise, it should indicate failure.

// Navigate to the webpage and locate the download link
WebElement pdfLink = driver.findElement(By.linkText("Download a Printable PDF of this Cheat Sheet"));
// Download the file
downloadFile("https://example.com/sample.pdf", "downloaded_file.pdf");
// Verify if the file is downloaded
if (Files.exists(Paths.get("downloaded_file.pdf"))) {
    System.out.println("PDF file downloaded successfully.");
} else {
    System.out.println("PDF file not downloaded.");
}
#Additional Notes
This utility is designed to work with Selenium WebDriver in Java environments.
Make sure to handle exceptions and edge cases appropriately in your code.
